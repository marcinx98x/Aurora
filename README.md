## <img src="docs/icons/features.svg" width="22" align="top"> Features

### <img src="docs/icons/search.svg" width="18" align="top"> Discovery & search
- **Real YouTube search** through the resolver — debounced 350 ms, with Tracks / Playlists / Albums chips.
- **Live autocomplete** from YouTube's own suggestion endpoint, plus a persisted **search history** (tap to re-run, per-item delete, one-tap clear).
- **Home dashboard**: parallax `SliverAppBar` header, carousels for **For you** (personalized from listening history), Trending, Top Charts, Recently played and Quick downloads.
- **Three states, one height** per section — shimmer skeleton, empty card, error card with a **Retry pill** that refetches only that carousel. Nothing jumps when a future resolves.

### <img src="docs/icons/play.svg" width="18" align="top"> Playback
- Audio streams through the proxy as `audio/mp4` over HTTP **Range** — seeking is instant.
- **Dual source**: remote YouTube and local device files run through the same `just_audio` engine.
- Queue with **shuffle**, **repeat one/all** and **drag-to-reorder**.
- **Crossfade**, 2–12 s, adjustable.
- **Remember playback position** (Settings → Audio, on by default) — after closing the app, the **mini-player** reappears immediately with the last track, artwork, and progress bar. Audio loads only when you press Play and resumes from the saved scrub position. Session data stays on-device (not synced to the server).
- **Sleep timer**: 5–60 min presets or **End of track**, with a 10-second fade-out.
- 5-band **equalizer**, playback **speed**, **output picker**, right-edge **volume drag HUD**.

### <img src="docs/icons/player.svg" width="18" align="top"> The Now-Playing screen
- Full-screen layout: blurred artwork behind a colour veil derived from the cover.
- **Two-role dynamic colour** — a vivid *accent* for marks, a deep same-hue *backdrop* for the wash, each held to its WCAG ratio. See [Colour](#colour).
- **Waveform seeker** — custom-painted bars with an elastic bump near the finger and a haptic tick per bar.
- **Album-art pulse**: orbiting particles and a breathing ring that speeds up while playing.
- **Synced lyrics** (lrclib) that open at and follow the active line; tap a line to seek.
- **Shareable lyric card** — hold a line, pick 1–6 lines, share as a rendered PNG.

### <img src="docs/icons/library.svg" width="18" align="top"> Library
- Tabs: **Playlists · On device · Downloaded · Queue**.
- **Import from a link** — paste a YouTube playlist / album / mix URL, get a local playlist.
- **Liked Songs** with an optional **auto-download** switch that also backfills earlier likes.
- **Downloads**: MP3 + lyrics, pause / resume / cancel, offline playback, set as **ringtone** or **alarm**.
- **On-device music** via MediaStore, grouped by folder, with per-folder show/hide.
- **Listening stats**: hours listened, play counts, top artists, most played.

### <img src="docs/icons/offline.svg" width="18" align="top"> Offline Sanctuary
- Connectivity is watched live. Offline, non-downloaded items **fade to 40 %** and stop responding, and a breathing **"Offline Sanctuary"** pill appears under the header.

### <img src="docs/icons/spark.svg" width="18" align="top"> Micro-interactions
- **Aurora pull-to-refresh** — a glowing orb that scales with overscroll, not the Material spinner.
- ~300 ms cross-fades, fade-up page transitions, `HapticFeedback` on play/pause, nav, scrub and toggles.
- Real `BackdropFilter` glass everywhere, each surface in its own `RepaintBoundary`.

## <img src="docs/icons/design.svg" width="22" align="top"> Design system — "Soft Dark / Glass"

### <img src="docs/icons/contrast.svg" width="18" align="top"> Colour

Artwork colours have to fill two jobs that pull in opposite directions, and using one colour
for both is what makes dynamic-theme players unreadable. `core/theme/dynamic_palette.dart`
splits them and holds each to a WCAG 2.1 ratio:

| Role | Derivation | Guarantee |
|---|---|---|
| `Tone.accent` | vivid, lightened until it passes | **≥ 3:1** vs the darkest surface (non-text UI minimum) |
| `Tone.backdrop` | same hue, desaturated, darkened until it passes | **≥ 4.5:1** for the dimmest label drawn on it |
| `Tone.onColor` | black or white, whichever scores higher | a legible glyph on any accent |

The veil stays neutral until `palette_generator` returns, then cross-fades in — before that a
track only carries an id-hash colour, which has nothing to do with its cover.

Glass surfaces also put a dark scrim under their white sheen: `BackdropFilter` preserves the
colour behind it, so a white-only fill turns into a bright smear over album art.

### <img src="docs/icons/tokens.svg" width="18" align="top"> Tokens

| Token | Value | Use |
|---|---|---|
| Void black | `#0B0C10` | deepest background |
| Base / Elevated | `#121212` · `#181818` · `#242424` | surfaces, cards |
| Emerald / Neon | `#1DB954` · `#00E676` | accent, playback, glow |
| Text | `#FFFFFF` · `#B3B3B3` · `#9A9A9A` | primary · muted · tertiary |
| Glass stroke | `white @ 10 %` | hairline borders |

**Type** Plus Jakarta Sans on a tight scale (`AppType`) · **Spacing/radii** 4-pt scale (`Sp`, `Radii`) ·
**Motion** fade-through with a slight upward slide on route push.

## <img src="docs/icons/server.svg" width="22" align="top"> The resolver server (`/server`)

Client-side scraping gets rate-limited and `403`'d per device IP and breaks whenever YouTube
changes. `yt-dlp` is the most robust extractor available, so it runs server-side: one stable IP,
a shared cache, and a Range-seekable audio proxy.

**Docker Hub:** [`marcinx98x/aurora-server`](https://hub.docker.com/r/marcinx98x/aurora-server) — recommended for Synology NAS, VPS, or any Docker host. No local Python or `Dockerfile` required on the server.

```
GET /health
GET /search?q=…&limit=20     → [{id, title, artist, duration, thumbnail, views}]
GET /stream?v=VIDEO_ID       → audio bytes · HTTP Range · persistent cache
GET /lyrics?title=&artist=   → synced LRC when lrclib has it, else plain text
GET /playlist?url=…          → {title, uploader, tracks[]} from a playlist / album / mix link
GET /suggest?q=…             → search autocomplete (returns [] on failure, never throws)
GET/PUT /sync                → Firebase-authenticated account backup and restore
```

### Docker Compose (recommended)

The compose file pulls a pre-built image from Docker Hub (`pull_policy: always`). You only need `.env`, `cache/`, and `data/` on the host.

```bash
cd server
cp .env.example .env
# Required in .env: AURORA_SECRET_KEY, FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
curl http://localhost:18000/health   # → {"ok":true}
```

| Setting | Value |
|---------|--------|
| Image | `marcinx98x/aurora-server:latest` |
| Host port | **18000** (maps to container **8000**) |
| `./cache` | Stream cache (audio + SQLite index) |
| `./data` | User sync database (Firebase backup) |

**Synology NAS:** copy `docker-compose.yml` and `.env` to your Docker folder (e.g. `/volume1/docker/aurora`), then run the same `docker compose pull && docker compose up -d` via SSH or Container Manager. Point Cloudflare/your reverse proxy at port **18000**.

**Update to a new release:**

```bash
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
```

One-liner without Compose:

```bash
docker pull marcinx98x/aurora-server:latest
docker run -d --name aurora-server \
  -p 18000:8000 \
  --env-file .env \
  -v ./cache:/app/cache \
  -v ./data:/app/data \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  marcinx98x/aurora-server:latest
```

Full server docs: [`server/README.md`](server/README.md).

Pushes to `main` that touch `server/**` auto-publish a new image via GitHub Actions (secret `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN` or `MARCINX98X`).

### Local Python (development)

```bash
cd server
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env to add optional registry settings and choose a cache limit.
# AURORA_CACHE_MAX_BYTES=unlimited keeps cached songs permanently.
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --env-file .env
```

Downloaded tracks are stored under `server/cache` and indexed by YouTube video ID in
SQLite, so later requests and server restarts reuse the same file. The cache is unlimited by
default; set `AURORA_CACHE_MAX_BYTES=10GB` (or another size) to enable LRU eviction.

When signed in with Google, **playlists**, **liked songs**, **recently played**, download
metadata, lyrics, listening stats, and app settings are backed up to the private resolver's
SQLite database (per Firebase user). Liked songs sync immediately on every heart tap; history
and stats upload shortly after playback (and flush before sign-out so nothing is lost). After
reinstall or signing back in, data is restored from the server; signing out clears local
personal data on the device (server copy is kept). Search history stays on-device only.

Verify sync is configured on your server:

```powershell
.\server\scripts\verify_sync.ps1
# Expect HTTP 401 on /sync (auth required). HTTP 503 means FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID is missing — restart the container.
```

For YouTube requests from a datacenter/VPS, create the private proxy list from
the safe example:

```bash
cd server
cp proxies.example.txt proxies.txt
# Replace the example with real proxies, one per line.
```

Accepted formats are `http://user:pass@ip:port`, `user:pass@ip:port`,
`ip:port:user:pass`, and `ip:port`. The resolver chooses a proxy randomly,
rotates to a different one after a failed attempt, and temporarily excludes
failed proxies for 30 minutes. `server/proxies.txt` is gitignored; only the
placeholder-only `server/proxies.example.txt` belongs in GitHub.

## <img src="docs/icons/run.svg" width="22" align="top"> Run the app

Needs **Flutter 3.27+** (`Color.withValues`, AGP-9 toolchain).

First, set up your environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your Vercel registry URL and fallback LAN IP
```

Then run the app:
```bash
flutter pub get
flutter run --dart-define-from-file=.env
```

By default the app resolves the backend URL from a Vercel registry at launch and falls back to
the LAN address in `lib/core/config/app_config.dart`. To pin it to a resolver running next to
you, skip the registry:

```bash
# Android emulator → host machine at 10.0.2.2:8000
flutter run --dart-define-from-file=.env --dart-define=AURORA_LOCAL=true

# physical phone on the same Wi-Fi
flutter run --dart-define-from-file=.env \
            --dart-define=AURORA_LOCAL=true \
            --dart-define=AURORA_API=http://192.168.0.5:8000
```

### Server Security (Secret Key)
To prevent unauthorized access to your FastAPI resolver server:
1. Set `AURORA_SECRET_KEY` in `server/.env`:
   ```bash
   AURORA_SECRET_KEY="your_custom_secret_key"
   ```
2. Pass the key when building or running the Flutter app:
   ```bash
   flutter run --dart-define=AURORA_SECRET_KEY="your_custom_secret_key"
   ```
   Or when building APK:
   ```bash
   flutter build apk --release \
     --dart-define=AURORA_FALLBACK_LAN=http://YOUR_SERVER_IP:8000 \
     --dart-define=AURORA_SECRET_KEY="your_custom_secret_key"
   ```

### Firebase & Google Sign-In Setup
To enable Google Sign-In and Cloud Sync:
1. Place your `google-services.json` in `android/app/`.
2. Set `AURORA_GOOGLE_WEB_CLIENT_ID` in `.env` (Firebase Console → Authentication → Google → **Web client ID**).
3. Go to **Firebase Console** -> **Project Settings** -> **Your Android App**.
4. Obtain your signing certificate SHA-1 fingerprint:
   ```bash
   cd android && ./gradlew signingReport
   ```
5. Copy the `SHA-1` (and `SHA-256`) fingerprint for your debug/release keystore and add it under **SHA certificate fingerprints** in Firebase Console. *(Without SHA-1 registered in Firebase, Google Sign-In will return an error on mobile devices).*
6. Set `FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID` in `server/.env` to match your Firebase project.

Grant the audio permission for the **On device** tab.

## Publish releases

### Android APK

The Android workflow builds an installable APK for every `main` push and pull request. To
publish a version, push a semantic version tag:

```bash
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
```

GitHub Actions uses the tag as the Android version, creates a GitHub Release with generated
notes, and uploads `Aurora-Music.apk` plus its SHA-256 checksum.

Build locally:

```bash
flutter build apk --release --dart-define-from-file=.env
```

### Docker server image

Pushes to `main` that change `server/**` build and push [`marcinx98x/aurora-server`](https://hub.docker.com/r/marcinx98x/aurora-server) when a Docker Hub token is configured in GitHub Actions secrets:

| Secret | Value |
|--------|--------|
| `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN` | Docker Hub access token (Read & Write) |

Alternatively, a secret named `MARCINX98X` with the same token also works. The Docker Hub username is fixed to `marcinx98x` in the workflow.

You can also trigger **Publish Docker Hub** manually from the Actions tab.
